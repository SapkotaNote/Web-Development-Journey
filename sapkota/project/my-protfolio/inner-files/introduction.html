        <p>
            HyperText Markup Language is referred to as HTML. Web pages and web applications are created using this standard language. HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. In other words, it's used to specify how a website's content is organized.
            
            HTML code is read by web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, which then present it as a visual web page. A website would be just plain text without any formatting, headings, images, or links if it didn't use HTML.</p>

        <h2>2. Why is HTML important?</h2>

<p>HTML is the foundation of every website. Here’s why it matters:

Provides Structure
HTML organizes the content of a website into elements like headings, paragraphs, images, lists, links, and more. For example, headings (h1 to h6'') tell the browser what text is important, and paragraphs (p) separate blocks of text.

Connects to Other Web Technologies
HTML works with CSS and JavaScript. CSS is used to style the HTML content, making it look beautiful, while JavaScript adds interactivity. Without HTML, CSS and JavaScript have nothing to act on.

Supports Accessibility and SEO
Well-written HTML helps search engines understand your website. It also makes your site accessible to people with disabilities who use screen readers or other assistive technologies.
